# PracticeShapes.github.io

## Description:
I have learned to create shapes in Week 2 of my MIT certificate program. In this exercise I practices creating a pattern with circles that I created. I used different colors and placed each circle in a specific spot so that it created this pattern.

## Installation:
I coded this onto Visual Studio Code then uploaded it to github. I first created the circle shape using **border-radius: 50%**. Then I  positioned each circle where I wanted it, added color and kept them all the same size with **height and width at 100px**

## Usage: 
You can not do much with just these shapes and this pattern. I will have a separate project where I will get the circles to move in and out of place.

## Support: 
You can always check out sites such as **Stack Overflow** or **FreeCodeCamp** and ask for help if you get stuck on anything.

## Roadmap: 
I plan to have a separate project where I will get the circles to move in and out of place.
